My expectation is that by the end of this project i can have a good understading of how to create basic web pages using HTML and CSS techniques. It has been almost 1 month ago since I first started with the Odin project. Two hours a day average and may be a little slow but i'm enjoying the journey. Can't wait to keep learning and practising.
